Machine learning types can be summarized as follows:
1/Supervised Learning:
Description: Trains on labeled data to predict outcomes.
Algorithms: Linear regression, SVM, decision trees.
Applications: Spam detection, image classification.

2/Unsupervised Learning:
Description: Finds patterns in unlabeled data.
Algorithms: K-means, PCA, hierarchical clustering.
Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

3/Reinforcement Learning:
Description: Learns by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards, it's the most used type nowadays.
Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Q-learning, policy gradients.
Applications: Game playing, robotic control.
